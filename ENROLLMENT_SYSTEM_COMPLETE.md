  - Synchronizes with backend

### Backend Components

**New Models:**
- **Enrollment** (`BEDB/app/models/enrollment.py`)
  ```python
  class Enrollment(Document):
      course_id: PydanticObjectId
      student_id: PydanticObjectId
      enrolled_at: datetime
      status: str  # "active" | "completed" | "dropped"

  ```

**New Schemas:**
- **EnrollmentCreate/Response** (`BEDB/app/schemas/enrollment.py`)
  - Request/response models
  - Validation rules
  - Type safety

**New Routers:**
1. **Student Router** (`BEDB/app/routers/student.py`)

   - `GET /api/v1/instructor/courses/{course_id}/students` - Get course students
   - `GET /api/v1/instructor/courses/{course_id}/analytics` - Get analytics
   - `GET /api/v1/instructor/dashboard` - Get dashboard overview
   - `GET /api/v1/instructor/students` - Get all students

### Database Schema

```
┌─────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│    User     │         │  Enrollment  │         │   Course    │
├─────────────┤         ├──────────────┤         ├─────────────┤
│ _id         │◄───────┤ student_id   │         │ _id         │
│ email       │         │ course_id    ├────────►│ title       │
│ role        │         │ enrolled_at  │         │ visibility  │
│ ...         │         │ status       │         │ owner_id    │
└─────────────┘         │ progress     │         │ ...         │
                        │ last_accessed│         └─────────────┘
                        └──────────────┘
```

**Relationships:**
- `Enrollment.student_id` → `User._id` (Many-to-One)
- `Enrollment.course_id` → `Course._id` (Many-to-One)
