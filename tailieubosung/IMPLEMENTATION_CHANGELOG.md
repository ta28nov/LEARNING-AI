## 💡 Notes for Developers

1. **Enrollment Logic**: 
   - Students can only enroll in PUBLIC or approved PRIVATE courses
   - Cannot enroll in DRAFT courses
   - Can re-enroll in previously dropped courses

2. **Progress Calculation**:
   - Course progress calculated from ChapterProgress entries
   - Average progress shown in dashboards
   - Time spent aggregated from all chapters

3. **Instructor Analytics**:
   - Enrollment count updated automatically on enroll/unenroll
   - Completion rate = (completed_students / total_enrollments) * 100
   - Average time spent calculated from unique users' chapter progress

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Compound indexes for fast enrollment queries
   - Use `.in_()` queries for multi-course operations
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed analytics

**🎉 Phase 1 Complete!** - Core enrollment system ready for testing and deployment.
